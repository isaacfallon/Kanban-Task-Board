# Kanban-Task-Board

## Description

This project is a task board application built using Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery and Day.js

This project was built to help manage individual projects or tasks in a 'kanban' style board. Completing this project solves the problem of not having a way to easily add, track and manage tasks in a digitally convenient way. This is achieved through reactive functionality by allowing tasks to be dragged and dropped into lanes representing their status, colour changes for each task depending on its due date and the fact the tasks will remain in local storage. 

My biggest takeaway from completing this project was expanding my understanding of how to use the Javascript libraries of Bootstrap, jQuery and Day.js to greater effect. Digging into the documentation and utilising them in unison taught me that these libraries can not only reduce development time, but be powerful tools in their own right.

## Credits

Some small snippets of code were inspired by the 'mini-project-5 task board' assigned to us alongside this challenge project. 
The main part utilised from that codebase is the syntax for the 'drop' functionality found in lines 142 to 152 in this project's script.js file. 

### Screenshot of script.js file showing the drop functionality utilised from mini-project-5:

All credit for these lines of code goes to the original programmers who set up the codebase for the bootcamp's mini-project-5 task board.
